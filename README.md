# Software Engineer | Java, Python | Backend Development | AI/ML & Cloud Fundamentals  

I am a Software Engineer with **1+ year of experience in IT infrastructure and production support, working across large-scale Linux and Windows environments**. In my current role, I’ve handled troubleshooting, patching, incident resolution, and ticket-based support for production systems, giving me strong exposure to real-world system behavior, reliability concerns, and operational best practices.

Alongside my support responsibilities, I’ve actively been transitioning toward **software development and AI/ML engineering**, reinforcing my fundamentals in backend development with Java, MySQL, and Python, while also deepening my familiarity with AI/ML workflows, data preprocessing, and basic model training concepts. I regularly apply these skills in personal projects documented on my GitHub profile.
